# 🎯 InterviewVault — Smarter Interview Preparation with AI

Most candidates prepare for interviews using random questions, generic answers, and blind job applications.  
**InterviewVault** was built to change that.

InterviewVault is an **AI-powered interview preparation platform** that helps candidates prepare based on their **resume, target job roles, and real interview expectations** — not guesswork.

**The goal is simple:**  
Help candidates prepare smarter, apply more confidently, and walk into interviews with clarity.

## 💡 Why InterviewVault?

During interview preparation, I noticed three common problems:

- Candidates practice **generic questions** unrelated to their resume or job role  
- People **apply randomly** without knowing which roles actually fit their skills  
- Resumes often get rejected by **ATS systems** before reaching recruiters  

InterviewVault addresses these problems using **Generative AI combined with structured workflows**.
