🎯 InterviewVault — Smarter Interview Preparation with AI

Most candidates prepare for interviews using random questions, generic answers, and blind job applications.
InterviewVault was built to change that.

InterviewVault is an AI-powered interview preparation platform that helps candidates prepare based on their resume, target job roles, and real interview expectations, rather than guesswork.

The goal is simple:

Help candidates prepare smarter, apply more confidently, and walk into interviews with clarity.

💡 Why InterviewVault?

During interview preparation, I noticed three common problems:

Candidates practice generic questions unrelated to their resume or job role

People apply randomly without knowing which roles actually fit their skills

Resumes are often rejected by ATS systems before reaching recruiters

InterviewVault addresses all three problems using Generative AI + structured workflows.
